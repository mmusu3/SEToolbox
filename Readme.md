#### This project is a fork of the original with fixes and changes for newer versions of Space Engineers.

I lack the time for active development of SE Toolbox and so I am only providing compatibilty fixes for game updates as they are needed.

The original author [midspace](https://github.com/midspace) has retired from working on [the original SE Toolbox](https://github.com/midspace/SEToolbox) as of 2019-08-23 and put it into maintainance mode as described [here](https://forum.keenswh.com/threads/7402115/).
